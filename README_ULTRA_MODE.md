2. **Health Checker** - Hits `/health` every 120 seconds
3. **Random Pinger** - Random endpoints every 90-150 seconds
4. **Activity Simulator** - Simulates user activity every 90 seconds
5. **Connection Monitor** - Checks connections every 60 seconds
6. **Main Keep-Alive** - Self-ping every 120 seconds
7. **Status Monitor** - Bot status checks every 60 seconds
8. **Data Refresher** - Refreshes data every 90 seconds
9. **Heartbeat Generator** - System heartbeat every 60 seconds

**Additional Systems:**
- CPU Keep-Busy (prevents idle detection)
- Memory Warmer (prevents cold starts)

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Ultra-aggressive keepalive mode"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Render Will Auto-Deploy

- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Check logs in Render dashboard
- Look for: "‚ö° ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE MODE"

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Test these URLs:
```
https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/
https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/health
https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/api/status
```

### Step 4: Setup External Monitor (CRITICAL)

**UptimeRobot (FREE):**
1. Go to: https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Sign up (takes 1 minute)
3. Add monitor:
   - Type: HTTP(s)
   - URL: `https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/health`
   - Interval: 5 minutes
4. Save

**This gives you 99%+ uptime!**

## üìà Expected Results

### Without UptimeRobot
- Uptime: ~95-98%
- May still spin down occasionally
- Still much better than basic setup

### With UptimeRobot
- Uptime: **99%+**
- Rarely spins down
- Comparable to Starter tier

## üîç Monitor Your Bot

### Check System Health

```
https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "bot_connected": true,
  "bot_running": true,
  "uptime": 86400,
  "current_capital": 5.23
}
```

### Check Render Logs

- Total: ~10-15 pings per 5 minutes
- Randomized intervals to look like real traffic

### 2. Background Workers
- Continuously monitor bot health
- Keep memory and connections warm
- Auto-save state every 5 minutes

### 3. Performance Optimizers
- Light CPU activity (prevents idle detection)
- Memory warming (prevents cold starts)
- Connection keeping (maintains active connections)

### 4. Auto-Recovery
- Detects connection issues
- Automatically attempts recovery
- Logs all recovery attempts

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Maximum Uptime

1. **Setup UptimeRobot** (2 minutes, HUGE improvement)
2. **Add Cron-job.org** as backup monitor (optional)
3. **Check logs daily** for first week
4. **Enable UptimeRobot alerts** (email/SMS when bot goes down)
5. **Monitor capital** regularly

### If Bot Still Spins Down

**Option 1:** Add more external monitors
- UptimeRobot (5 min)
- Cron-job.org (5 min)
- Both together = even better uptime

**Option 2:** Reduce ping intervals (edit files)
- `aggressive_keepalive.py` line 60: Change `90` to `60`
- `keep_alive_system.py` line 15: Change `120` to `90`

**Option 3:** Upgrade to Starter ($7/month)
- Guaranteed 24/7, never spins down
- Worth it for serious trading

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Bot Goes to Sleep
‚úÖ Check if all 9 threads started (view logs)
‚úÖ Add UptimeRobot if not setup
‚úÖ Reduce ping intervals (see Pro Tips)

### High Resource Usage
‚úÖ This is normal - multiple threads running
‚úÖ Still within free tier limits
‚úÖ CPU usage should be <1%

### Pings Failing
‚úÖ Verify app URL is correct
‚úÖ Check if dashboard is accessible
‚úÖ Test health endpoint manually

### No Trades Executing
‚úÖ Click "Start Trading" in dashboard
‚úÖ Verify API keys are set
‚úÖ Check trading mode is correct
