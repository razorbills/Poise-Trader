   ```

5. Choose **"Free"** plan
6. Click **"Create Web Service"**

---

### **STEP 4: Wait for Deployment (5 min)**

Render will:
- ✅ Clone your repo
- ✅ Install ALL dependencies (including ML libraries!)
- ✅ Start your bot
- ✅ Provide a live URL (e.g., `https://poise-trader-bot.onrender.com`)

You can watch the logs in real-time!

---

### **STEP 5: Verify It's Running (1 min)**

1. Open your Render service URL in browser
2. You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "alive",
     "bot": {
       "status": "running",
       "trades": 0,
       "capital": 5.0
     },
     "uptime": 123.45
   }
   ```

3. Check `/status` endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/status`

---

## 📱 **Add Telegram Notifications**

In Render dashboard:

1. Go to your service
2. Click **"Environment"** tab
3. Add these variables:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = your_bot_token_here
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = your_chat_id_here
   ```
4. Service auto-restarts with notifications enabled!

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

The `web_service_launcher.py`:
- ✅ Runs your bot in background thread
- ✅ Serves a web endpoint (required for Render)
- ✅ Provides health check at `/`
- ✅ Bot status at `/status`
- ✅ Keeps service alive 24/7

**Why this works:**
- Render free web services stay alive as long as they respond to HTTP requests
- Your bot runs in background while Flask serves HTTP
- Perfect for 24/7 trading bot!

---

## 💰 **Cost Breakdown:**

**Free Tier Limits:**
- ✅ 750 hours/month (31 days × 24 hours = 744 hours)
- ✅ Enough for ONE 24/7 service
- ✅ 512MB RAM
- ✅ Shared CPU

**After Free Hours:**
- Service spins down (sleeps)

- OR upgrade to paid ($7/month for always-on)

**For 24/7 within free tier:**
